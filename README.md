# Discrete Learning
Discrete Learning is an interactive website for students to solve advanced math problems

## Overview
We know that many computer science students struggle in Discrete Math, so we've created a website to help solve that issue. The main purpose is to give students a way to easily practice problems outside of class. 

## Topics covered
Discrete Maths: Basic concepts of logic and basic concepts of proofs, truth tables
Linear Algebra: Matrix Operation, Systems of Linear Equations, Determinants, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
